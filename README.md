# iPhone case modeling

I wanted an excuse to learn KCL better, I like the idea of reproducable 3D modeling, and have wanted to design an 3D-printable iPhone mount for my car. Before building the mount, I wanted to practice modeling the iPhone itself.

This repository builds a 3D model of an iPhone 16 Pro using [Zoo.dev](https://zoo.dev/)'s [Modeling app](https://zoo.dev/modeling-app) in [KCL](https://zoo.dev/docs/kcl).
